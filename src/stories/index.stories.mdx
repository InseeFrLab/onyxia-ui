```bash
yarn add onyxia-ui @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled tss-react powerhooks
```

Add this script to your `package.json`
```diff
"scripts": {
    "prepare": "fetch-material-icons"
}
```

At this stage, the documentation is under the form of a very simple [demo project](https://github.com/garronej/onyxia-ui/tree/main/src/test).  
The actual theme configuration [happens here](https://github.com/garronej/onyxia-ui/blob/main/src/test/src/theme.ts).  
If you want to experiment with it you can run the demo app with:

NOTE for [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) users: As of writing this lines storybook still uses by default emotion 10.  
mui and TSS runs emotion 11 so there is [some changes](https://github.com/garronej/onyxia-ui/blob/324de62248074582b227e584c53fb2e123f5325f/.storybook/main.js#L31-L32)
to be made to your `.storybook/main.js` to make it uses emotion 11.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garronej/onyxia-ui
cd onyxia-ui
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```
