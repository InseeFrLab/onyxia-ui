# Tabs

This is a documentation of `<Tabs/>` component.
Tabs are used to organize and navigate between related content on the same page.
Tabs ensure that large amounts of content can be organized in a manner that is easier
to digest for the user. Tabs are arranged in bars of tabs called tab groups, with the tab
label providing the user with an indication of what content will be revealed when the tab is selected.

-   Do not use tabs if users need to read the content of all sections.
-   Do not use for too long content where tabs are difficult to find after reading.
-   Only one tab should be active at a given time.
-   Tabs should be positioned in a single, scrollable (if needed) row above the content it relates to.
-   Pay attention to the maximum number of tabs. consider further splitting the content or using a different navigation component.
-   Do not use tabs to create a sequence or progression of content that the user is expected to read in a given order.

-   Do not use tabs to navigate users to a different page.
