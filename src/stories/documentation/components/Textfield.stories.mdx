</Canvas>

## Rules of use

-   Keep the same label for fields requesting the same information
-   A help text may accompany this wording to clarify in particular the nature of the expected content.
    If a precise format is expected, it should be indicated as clearly as possible and given examples.
-   Information should not be hidden in a tooltip or infobox, if this content is essential to enter the field.
-   The eye spontaneously read from bottom to top, display the fields in a vertical list to facilitate reading and optimize ergonomics
-   Use a primary button to validate an input field or a form, the secondary button will be used to go back, reset the form or abandon the input.
-   The submission of a field must be followed by a message indicating the success or not of the desired action
-   Label the form as (optional) when the input is not required.
-   Avoid the use of placeholder as it can confuse the user. However, if you wish to use, it is necessary
    to respect the proposed color in order to remain accessible, and its content must present information
    not essential to understanding the field. In no case can it replace a label and it is only to be reserved
    for secondary input aids.
